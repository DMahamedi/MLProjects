# Introduction

This repository contains different folders where I use and apply different machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. The files do not necessarily follow a uniform format, instead I try to do things slightly differently in each report so I can get out of my comfort zone. For example, in the *Kernelization* and *BinaryClassification* files I stick to importing the models from scikit-learn, whereas in *LinearRegression* I designed an implemented my own linear regression functions using Pandas and Numpy.
